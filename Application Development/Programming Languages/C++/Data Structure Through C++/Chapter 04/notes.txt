//Dynamic memory allocation

ptr = (int*)malloc(100 * sizeof(int));
Since the size of int is 4 bytes,
this statement will allocate 400 bytes of memory.
And, the pointer ptr holds the address of the first byte in the allocated memory.
If space is insufficient, allocation fails and returns a NULL pointer.
